It is possible to use apt to install golang - golang-go

It is also possible to add PPA so we can install different versions
    - https://launchpad.net/%7Elongsleep/+archive/ubuntu/golang-backports 

But golang documentation recommands to download from go website
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Golang documentation recommend to download the zip and extract the content
Download - https://go.dev/doc/install
Archived versions - https://go.dev/dl/

2. In linux -
Unzip the package and add the bin locaton to the PATH variable
- in .profile
PATH="/home/song/Development/golang/go/bin:$PATH" - Check step 5 => $(go env GOPATH)

3. Check version -
which go
go version

4. GOROOT/GOPATH/GOBIN -
It is normally good to keep the default
go env GOROOT
go env GOPATH
go env GOBIN -> This normally not set, utilities installed to GOPATH/bin

GOROOT - The directory where the go executable is placed
GOPATH - The directory where the go workspace - default = "~/go"
GOBIN - The directory where "go intall" command to install additional utilities, default GOPATH/bin

5. Add the GOPATH/bin to the PATH variable, so we can run the go utilities
- in .profile
PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH"

6. GOPROXY
go env GOPROXY -> by default = https://proxy.golang.org,direct
If use a different proxy, need to set this environment variable

7. GOSUMDB
If non-default GOPROXY is used, it may also need to set environment variable GOSUMDB=off
