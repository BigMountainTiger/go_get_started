1. It is possible to download an installer, but I prefer to download the zip and unzip ot to a folder
2. Add the bin folder to the user's PATH
3. Add the GOBIN = GOPATH\bin to the user's PATH
4. If different GOPROXY (by default => https://proxy.golang.org,direct) is needed, set the environment variable to a different proxy
5. If non-default GOPROXY is used, it may also need to set environment variable GOSUMDB=off
