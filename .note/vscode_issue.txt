golang vscode plugin only supports go modules / workspaces in top level folders

-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. In order to put go modules / workspaces into subfolders, need to add these folders in a VSCODE workspace
    - see the "workspace-go-get-started.code-workspace" file
    
2. A golong workspace can have multiple golang modules in its subfolders
    - see the workspace_example
