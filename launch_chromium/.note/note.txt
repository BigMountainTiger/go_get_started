1. Download the zip -> unzip it
2. Change the name of the resulting directory to chromium
3. Rezip it to a zip file named "chromium.zip" => zip -r chromium.zip chromium/
4. Add the chromium.zip to the chromium directory in the project for the corresponding OS

The .scripts/build file will copy the zip file to the "build" directory before "go build"
